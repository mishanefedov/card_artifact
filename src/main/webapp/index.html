    <p>Hello everybody!</p>
    <p>My name is Michael. I'm studying Business Information Systems at the Technical University of Munich. Java was my entry into software development and is still my favorite programming language. I have also practiced other programming languages to broaden my possibilities. Some of my fellow students made me interested in web development, this motivated me to do this little project. This application is my entry-level in web development, so please don't be very critical.</p>
